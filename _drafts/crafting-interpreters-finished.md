I found a really good tutorial on [implementing interpreters][craft-web]{:target="_blank_"}. In order to get out the maximum of it I decided that I was going to port it to C++. The main reasons are:
1. With only reading the tutorial I can understand new concepts, algorithm etc. but it's not a well-founded knowledge. Implement it again with the same language (Java) as the tutorial uses also not gives much. Copying the code is also easliy forgetable.
2. I wanted to get more experience with modern C++ (14, 17, 20). In my opinion learning through a project (at work or with a hobby) is the best. And you can always back up the practice with theory. The two together is the best actually.
