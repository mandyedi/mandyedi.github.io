My girlfirend and me really like to play boardgames. One day we start to play KingDomino and after a several rounds of game I just had an idea...

Kingdomino's as its name suggests a domino like game but instead of pairs of numbers you have different pairs of grounds(???) like water, woods, desert, meadow and mine. You have one square item and this is your castle. You have to build your field(???) around it.

So we started to play it and as the rules suggests(???synonym) we choose to build a 5x5 territory. After a few rounds we switched to a more challenging mode where you play with all the available dominos (48) and build a 7x7 territory. And thats where I started to wonder: Can I build a perfect territory with all the dominos? Which means a 10x10 board and four castles. Being a software developer I decided to solve this problem programmatically.
