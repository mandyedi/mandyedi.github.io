Last spring I wrote a short post about my stages of problem solving. It was just a brief reflection on my way of problem solving. I knew there were plenty of room for improvement. Not so long ago I got a great chance to acquire the knowledge and delve into the beauty of problem solving.

As with any other self imprevement training this also started with knowing ourself. What type of pesonality we are, more precisly what many personal properties lay inside us and more importantly what are the balances, the ratios.

Note: practice always wins, problem solving is just an other skill.

What toolset can we learn?
