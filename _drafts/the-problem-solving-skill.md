Last spring I wrote a short post about my stages of problem solving. It was just a brief reflection on my way of problem solving. I knew there were plenty of room for improvement.
Not so long ago I got a great chance to acquire the knowledge and delve into the beauty of problem solving.

Just like with other self improvement training this one also started with knowing better ourself. What kind of personality we have, more precisely what personality types have the most weight in us because we are usualy a mixture of two or more kind.

One thing i learned for sure (again) that problem solving is just an other skill and practice always wins.

What toolset can we learn?
