I thought a lot about wether I should write a post about it or not, but there are two things I want to start: writing an IT blog and getting more experience in programming. None of them could happen without failure. I might be afraid a little bit that who is going to read it, what they are going to think about it etc.

Looking for a new job and taking interviews makes me realize what I've been really missing in my knowledge. Working for years is just not enough, because it depens on so many factors. Especially in IT.
