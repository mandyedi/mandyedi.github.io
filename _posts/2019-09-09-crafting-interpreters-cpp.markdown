I decided that I am going to delve into interpreters so I can understand more deeply how programming languages work. More precisely script languages as I am woorking on an interpreter not a compiler (at least now :) ).
I use a great [tutorial][craft-web]{:target="_blank_"} to accomplish this and to gain maximum knowledge I also answer to the given questions or do the challenges after every chapters. The tutorial's full source code is also available [here][craft-github]{:target="_blank_"}.
I am going to implement the whole interpreter in C++ and publish it in my [craftinginterpreters-cpp][craft-mine]{:target="_blank_"} github project.
